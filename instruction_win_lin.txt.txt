0. CMake
  - The project uses CMake as configuration creator. Under Windows it is recommended to install it from http://cmaketools.codeplex.com/.
  - Under Ubuntu it might be necessay to build CMake from sources (at the time of this writing we used CMake 2.8.11).
  - We made efforts to keep CMakeLists.txt files well documented. You should have no problems with manual adjustments of build settings. In particular it may be necessary to adjust paths for libcds and libssh (see the dependencies note below).


1. How to build the project
  - Dependencies: Boost (currently tested with Boost 1.54), libcds (currently 1.4.0), libssh.
  - Additional dependencies that are necessary and may or may not be present on your system: zlib, openssl.
  - On Windows only the 32 bit version was tested. Please remember that whenever you wish to use dynamically linked libraries (DLLs), they must be located in right directory. For the 64-bit DLLs the right directoy is c:/Windows/System32 (sic) and the 32-bit ones in c:/windows/SysWOW64 (sic).


2. Random remarks
  - As the IDE for Linux we recommend Eclipse with Git plugin.
  - We use CppCheck to statically validate the code against c++03 standard. Libcds uses C++11 features, but the rest of this project should not depend on C++11 features.
  - There exists a good (proprietary) plugin for VS2010: Visual Assist X. It makes IntelliSense work well with C++.
  - The docs on libcds website are out of date. Please use the ones generated by doxygen while building libcds.


3. How it works?
  - cql_cluster_t - This class holds the list of available hosts and creates new sessions. In addition, it creates a thread which is responsible for asynchronous I/O.
  - cql_session_t - Session is a sequence of queries and responses to/from DB. It holds a list of active cql_connection_t's. Connections are created according to policies. Unused ones are moved to _trashcan, and then (if idle fo 10 minutes) closed.
  - cql_connection_t - Single connection to the DB. It handles the options, exchanges START frames and provides authorization. A connection holds up to 128 virtual streams (cql_stream_t), so it can serve 128 concurrent queries. The class uses boost::asio for network I/O and returns responses by boost::promise.


4. Code Style:
- class names follow the general scheme "cql_xxx_yyy_t". The class "xxx_yyy" shall be put in files xxx_yyy.cpp and xxx_yyy.hpp.
- snake_case namespace names.
- snake_case method names and arguments.
- _snake_case class member fields (i.e. preceded with underscore).
- generics: template<class TMyParam, int Size>
- We recommend formatting with `astyle' command (Linux).
- No `using namespace ...' in header files. We avoid `using namespace' in general.
- Doxygen comments. Some day...
- For complex classes we use pimpl pattern with abstract base class.
