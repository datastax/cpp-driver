DataStax C/C++ Driver for Apache Cassandra (Beta)
===============================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/datastax/cpp-driver.svg?branch=rc1)](https://travis-ci.org/datastax/cpp-driver)

A C/C++ client driver for Apache Cassandra. This driver works exclusively with
the Cassandra Query Language version 3 (CQL3) and Cassandra's Binary Protocol (version 1 and 2).

- JIRA: https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/CPP
- MAILING LIST: https://groups.google.com/a/lists.datastax.com/forum/#!forum/cpp-driver-user
- IRC: #datastax-drivers on `irc.freenode.net <http://freenode.net>`

### Current Functionality and Design
- Completely asynchronous
- Exception safe
- Ad-hoc queries
- Prepared statements
- Batch statements
- Connection pool with auto-reconnect
- Cassandra collections
- Compatibility with binary protcol version 1 and 2
- Authentication (via credentials using SASL PLAIN)

### Upgrading from a beta5 to rc1

There were a couple breaking API changes between beta5 and rc1 that are documented in detail [here](http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/datastax-c-driver-rc1-released).

### TODO
- Compression
- Query tracing
- Event registration and notification
- Callback intefaces for load balancing, authenticaiton, reconnection and retry
- Packaging for Debian-based Linux, RHEL-based Linux and OS X
- Binary releases for Windows and Linux
- Getting started guide
- Improved documentation

## Building
The driver is known to work on OS X 10.9, Windows 7, RHEL 5/6, and Ubuntu 12.04/14.04. The driver itself currently has two dependencies: [libuv 0.10](https://github.com/joyent/libuv) and [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org/). To build the driver you will need [CMake](http://www.cmake.org). To test the driver you will also need to install [boost 1.55+](http://www.boost.org),  [libssh2](http://www.libssh2.org) and [ccm](https://github.com/pcmanus/ccm).

Note: The driver doesn't work with libuv 0.11

It has been built using GCC 4.1.2+, Clang 3.4+, and MSVC 2010/2013.

### OS X
The driver has been built and tested using the Clang compiler provided by XCode 5.1. The dependencies were obtained using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh).

To obtain dependencies:
```
brew install libuv cmake
```

Note: We currently use the OpenSSL library included with XCode.

To obtain test dependencies (This is not required):
```
brew install boost libssh2
```

To build:
```
git clone https://github.com/datastax/cpp-driver.git
cd cpp-driver
cmake .
make
```

### Windows
The driver has been built and tested using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 and 2013 (using the "Express" versions) on Windows 7 SP1. The dependencies need to be manually built or obtained.

To obtain dependencies:
* Download and install CMake for Windows. Make sure to select the option "Add CMake to the system PATH for all users" or "Add CMake to the system PATH for current user".
* Download and build the latest release of libuv 0.10 from https://github.com/joyent/libuv/releases.
  1. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/joyent/libuv#windows).
  2. Open up the generated Visual Studio solution "uv.sln".
  3. If you want a 64-bit build you will need to create a "x64" solution platform in the "Configuration Manager".
  4. Open "Properties" on the "libuv" project. Set "Multi-threaded DLL (/MD)" for the "Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Code Generation -> Runtime Library" option.
  5. Build the "libuv" project
  6. Copy the files in "libuv/include" to "cpp-driver/lib/libuv/include" and "libuv/Release/lib" to "cpp-driver/lib/libuv/lib".
* Download and install either the 32-bit or 64-bit version of OpenSSL from http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html. You may also need to install the "Visual C++ 2008 Redistributables".

To build 32-bit (using "VS2013 x86 Native Tools Command Prompt"):
```
cd <path to driver>/cpp-driver
cmake -G "Visual Studio 12"
msbuild cassandra.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release /t:Clean,Build
```

To build 64-bit (using "VS2013 x64 Cross Tools Command Prompt"):
```
cd <path to driver>/cpp-driver
cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 Win64"
msbuild cassandra.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release /t:Clean,Build
```

Note: Use "cmake -G "Visual Studio 10" for Visual Studio 2010

### Linux
The driver was built and tested using both GCC and Clang on Ubuntu 14.04.

To obtain dependencies (GCC):
```
sudo apt-get install g++ make cmake libuv-dev libssl-dev
```

To obtain dependencies (Clang):
```
sudo apt-get install clang make cmake libuv-dev libssl-dev
```

To obtain test dependencies (This is not required):
```
sudo apt-get install libboost-chrono-dev libboost-date-time-dev libboost-log-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-thread-dev libboost-test-dev libssh2-1-dev
```

To build:
```
git clone https://github.com/datastax/cpp-driver.git
cd cpp-driver
cmake .
make
```

## Building Tests
Tests are not built by default. To build the tests add "-DCASS_BUILD_TESTS=ON" when running cmake.

## Examples
There are several examples provided here: [examples](https://github.com/datastax/cpp-driver/tree/1.0/examples).

### A Simple Example
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cassandra.h>

int main() {
  /* Setup and connect to cluster */
  CassFuture* connect_future = NULL;
  CassCluster* cluster = cass_cluster_new();
  CassSession* session = cass_session_new();

  cass_cluster_set_contact_points(cluster, "127.0.0.1,127.0.0.2,127.0.0.3");

  connect_future = cass_session_connect(session, cluster);

  if (cass_future_error_code(connect_future) == CASS_OK) {
    CassFuture* close_future = NULL;

    /* Build statement and execute query */
    CassString query = cass_string_init("SELECT keyspace_name "
                                        "FROM system.schema_keyspaces;");
    CassStatement* statement = cass_statement_new(query, 0);

    CassFuture* result_future = cass_session_execute(session, statement);

    if(cass_future_error_code(result_future) == CASS_OK) {
      /* Retrieve result set and iterator over the rows */
      const CassResult* result = cass_future_get_result(result_future);
      CassIterator* rows = cass_iterator_from_result(result);

      while(cass_iterator_next(rows)) {
        const CassRow* row = cass_iterator_get_row(rows);
        const CassValue* value = cass_row_get_column_by_name(row, "keyspace_name");

        CassString keyspace_name;
        cass_value_get_string(value, &keyspace_name);
        printf("keyspace_name: '%.*s'\n", (int)keyspace_name.length,
                                               keyspace_name.data);
      }

      cass_result_free(result);
      cass_iterator_free(rows);
    } else {
      /* Handle error */
      CassString message = cass_future_error_message(result_future);
      fprintf(stderr, "Unable to run query: '%.*s'\n", (int)message.length,
                                                            message.data);
    }

    cass_statement_free(statement);
    cass_future_free(result_future);

    /* Close the session */
    close_future = cass_session_close(session);
    cass_future_wait(close_future);
    cass_future_free(close_future);
  } else {
    /* Handle error */
    CassString message = cass_future_error_message(connect_future);
    fprintf(stderr, "Unable to connect: '%.*s'\n", (int)message.length,
                                                        message.data);
  }

  cass_future_free(connect_future);
  cass_cluster_free(cluster);
  cass_session_free(session);

  return 0;
}
```
