# Retry policies

Retry polices allow the driver to automatically handle server-side failures when
Cassandra is unable to fulfill the consistency requirement of a request.

**Important**: Retry policies do not handle client-side failures such as
client-side timeouts or client-side connection issues. In these cases
application code must handle the failure and retry the request. The driver will
automatically recover requests that haven't been written, but once a request is
written the driver will return an error for in-flight requests and will not try
to automatically recover. This is done because not all operations are idempotent
and the driver is unable to distinguish which requests can automatically retried
without side effect. It's up to application code to make this distinction.

## Setting Retry Policy

By default, the driver uses the `default retry policy` for all requests unless
it is overridden. The retry policy can be set globally using
[`cass_cluster_set_retry_policy()`] or it can be set per statement or batch
using [`cass_statement_set_retry_policy()`] or
[`cass_batch_set_retry_policy()`], respectively.

## Default Retry Policy

The default retry policy will only retry a request when it is safe to do so
while preserving the consistency level of the request and it is likely to
succeed. In all other cases, this policy will return an error.

<table class="table table-striped table-hover table-condensed">
  <thead>
   <tr>
   <th>Failure Type</th>
   <th>Action</th>
   </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>Read Timeout</td>
   <td>Retry if the number of received responses is greater than or equal to the
   number of required responses, but the data was not received. Returns and
   error in all other cases.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Write Timeout</td>
   <td>Retry only if the request is a logged batch request and the request failed to
   write the batch log. Returns an error in all other cases.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Unavailable</td>
   <td>Retries the request using the next host in the query plan.</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

```c
CassRetryPolicy* default_policy = cass_retry_policy_default_new();

/* ... */

/* Retry policies must be freed */
cass_retry_policy_free(default_policy);
```

## Downgrading Consistency Retry Policy

This policy will retry in all the same scenarios as the default policy, and it
will also retry in cases where there is a chance to save the request at the cost
of lower the consistency. The goal of this policy is to be robust in the face of
transient failures. Read requests will succeed as long as there's a single copy available
and write wills succeed if there's at least a single copy persisted.

**Important:** This policy may attempt to retry request with a lower consistency
level. Using this policy can break consistency guarantees and shouldn't not be
used in application that required strong consistency.

<table class="table table-striped table-hover table-condensed">
  <thead>
   <tr>
   <th>Failure Type</th>
   <th>Action</th>
   </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>Read Timeout</td>
   <td>Retry with a lower consistency if some at least some replicas responded.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Write Timeout</td>
   <td>Retry unlogged batches at a lower consistency level if at least one
   replica responded. For single queries and other batch types if any replicas
   responded then consider the request successful and ignore the error.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Unavailable</td>
   <td>Retry with a lower consistency if some at least some replicas responded.</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

```c
CassRetryPolicy* downgrading_policy =
cass_retry_policy_downgrading_consistency_new();

/* ... */

/* Retry policies must be freed */
cass_retry_policy_free(downgrading_policy);
```

## Fallthrough Retry Policy

This policy never retries or ignores a server-side failures. Errors are always
returned. This policy is useful for application that want to handle retries
directly.

<table class="table table-striped table-hover table-condensed">
  <thead>
   <tr>
   <th>Failure Type</th>
   <th>Action</th>
   </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>Read Timeout</td>
   <td>Return error</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Write Timeout</td>
   <td>Return error</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Unavailable</td>
   <td>Return error</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

```c
CassRetryPolicy* fallthrough_policy =
cass_retry_policy_fallthrough_new();

/* ... */

/* Retry policies must be freed */
cass_retry_policy_free(fallthrough_policy);
```

## Logging

This policy can be added as a parent policy to all the other polices. It logs
the retry decision of its child policy. The log messages created by this policy
are done using the [`CASS_LOG_INFO`] level.

```c
CassRetryPolicy* default_policy = cass_retry_policy_default_new();
CassRetryPolicy* logging_policy = cass_retry_policy_logging_new(default_policy)

cass_cluster_set_retry_policy(cluster, logging_policy);

/* ... */

/* Retry policies must be freed */
cass_retry_policy_free(default_policy);
cass_retry_policy_free(logging_policy);
