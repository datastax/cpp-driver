# Consistency

A setting that defines a successful write or read by the number of cluster
replicas that acknowledge the write or respond to the read request,
respectively.

## Default consistency

The default consistency is `CASS_CONSISTENCY_LOCAL_ONE` for driver versions
2.2.2 and above. In the past, versions 2.2.1 and below, it was
`CASS_CONSISTENCY_QUORUM` or `CASS_CONSISTENCY_ONE` depending on the driver
version.

## Consistency Levels

### Read and Write Consistency Levels

The consistency level determines the number of replicas on which the read/write
must respond/succeed before returning an acknowledgment to the client
application. Descriptions and Usage scenarios for each read/write consistency
level can be found
[here](http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/latest/cassandra/dml/dmlConfigConsistency.html).

**NOTE:** Consistency level `CASS_CONSISTENCY_ANY` is only valid for write operation statements.

## Setting Consistency Level

A ['CassStatement'](http://datastax.github.io/cpp-driver/api/struct.CassFuture/) object
can have its consistency level altered at anytime before the statement is
executed by the session.

```c
CassStatement* statement = NULL;

/* Create a simple or prepared statment */

/* Ensure the session executed statement has strong consistency */
cass_statement_set_consistency(statement, CASS_CONSISTENCY_QUORUM);

cass_statement_free(statement);
```

**NOTE:** Consistency level is ignored for `USE`, `TRUNCATE`, `CREATE` and `ALTER`
statements, and some, like `CASS_CONSISTENCY_ANY`, arenâ€™t allowed in all situations.
