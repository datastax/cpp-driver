* Added functions to get schema metadata, `cass_session_get_schema()` can
  be use to get a snapshot of the schema metadata and `cass_meta_*()` functions
  can be used to retrieve detailed information about keyspaces, tables, and columns.

Other
--------
* Significantly improved request throughput by batching socket writes.
  Batch sizes can be configured using the function
  `cass_cluster_set_max_requests_per_flush()`. The default is 128 because
  the maximum write size is bounded by the number of pipelined requests
  per connection (for version 1 and 2 of the native protocol).
* Added backpressure mechanism that can be configured for by the
  number of outstanding bytes and the number of requests on a connection. These can
  be configured using `cass_cluster_set_write_bytes_high_water_mark()`,
  `cass_cluster_set_write_bytes_low_water_mark()`,
  `cass_cluster_set_pending_requests_high_water_mark()`, and
  `cass_cluster_set_pending_requests_low_water_mark()`.
* Fixed a crash caused by a request timing out followed by a
  call to the connection read callback then the write callback.
* Fixed an issue that prevented the driver from recovering from
  a full cluster outage.
* Fixed an issue that allowed `uv_queue_work()` to be called from an
  application thread.
* Added logic to prevent redundant node refreshes when establishing
  a new connection from multiple IO workers.
* Fixed a crash caused by Cassandra 2.1.0 not returning metadata on
  execute requests.
* Fixed a memory leak that could leak request handlers if the control
  connection ran out of stream ids.
* Fixed a crash caused by calling an invalid timeout callback
  when waiting for connection to become available in a pool.
* Build will use an external version of Boost if present.

1.0.0-beta4
===========
Sep 11, 2014

Features
--------
* Added node discovery and now handle topology/status change events
* Queries that modify schema wait for cluster schema agreement
* Added DC aware load balancing policy. The default policy is set to
  round robin.
* Added new methods to configure the load balancing policy,
  `cass_cluster_set_load_balance_round_robin()` and
  `cass_cluster_set_load_balance_dc_aware()`
* It is now possible for a session future to return an error when
  connecting to a cluster. This can occur when the driver is unable to connect
  to any contact points or the provided authentication credentials are invalid.

1.0.0-beta3
===========
Aug 13, 2014

Features
--------
* Added callbacks to futures, `cass_future_set_callback()`
* Added plaintext authentication support, `cass_cluster_set_credentials()`
* Added map iterator, `cass_iterator_from_map()`, key and value pairs can be
  retrieved using `cass_iterator_get_map_key()` and `cass_iterator_get_map_value()`
* Values can be bound by name (statements created from prepared statements only)
* Values can be retrieved by name from result sets

Other
---------
* Reduced overhead of prepared statements
* Small performance improvement for all queries via reduced allocations

1.0.0-beta2
===========
Jul 17, 2014

Features
--------
* Removed C++1x dependency
* Support for Cassandra 1.2 (native protocol version 1)
* Support for automatic paging
* Added method to set serial consistency on statement
* Added batch type to batches
* Exposed options `cass_cluster_set_max_pending_requests()`,
  `cass_cluster_set_max_simultaneous_creation()`, and
  `cass_cluster_set_max_simultaneous_requests_threshold()`
* Added `cass_result_column_name()` to get column name from a result set

Bug Fixes
---------
* Fixed `StreamManager` so it no longer causes stack corruption
* Fixed issue where connections would log "'Timed out during startup' error on startup for ..."
  when a Session was closed while a connection was during its startup process
* Fixed Row and collections iterator so they return the first and last item properly
* Improved logic for creating new connections so it''s based on request throughput

Other
---------
* Removed the `setopt` method added set methods for all options
* Removed the `getopt` method
* `cass_batch_new()` and `cass_collection_new()` no longer take a consistency parameter
* `cass_collection_new()` now requires a collection type parameter
* `is_map` parameter removed from `cass_statement_bind_collection()`

1.0.0-beta1
===========
Jun 16, 2014

Features
--------
* Support for Cassandra 2.0 (native protocol version 2)
* Support for prepared and batch statements
* Support for collections
