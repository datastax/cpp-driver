# Batches

Batches can be used to group multiple mutations (`UPDATE`, `INSERT`, `DELETE`) together into a single statement; simple or perpared. There are three different types of batches supported by Cassandra 2.0 or later.

* `CASS_BATCH_TYPE_LOGGED` is used to make sure that multiple mutations across multiple partitions happen atomically, that is, all the included mutations will eventually succeed. However, there is a performance penalty imposed by atomcity guarantee.
* `CASS_BATCH_TYPE_UNLOGGED` is generally used to group mutations for a single partition and do not suffer from the performance penalty imposed by logged batches, but there is no atomicty guarantee for  multi-partition updates.
* `CASS_BATCH_TYPE_COUNTER` is used to group counters updates.

**Important**: Be careful when using batches as a [performance optimization](http://www.datastax.com/documentation/cql/3.1/cql/cql_using/useBatch.html).

```c
/* This logged batch will makes sure that all the mutations eventually succeed */
CassBatch* batch = cass_batch_new(CASS_BATCH_TYPE_LOGGED);
 
/* Statements can be immediately freed after being added to the batch */
 
{
  CassStatement* statement
    = cass_statement_new(cass_string_init("INSERT INTO example1(key, value) VALUES ('a', '1')"), 0);
  cass_batch_add_statement(batch, statement);
  cass_statement_free(statement);
}
 
{
  CassStatement* statement
    = cass_statement_new(cass_string_init("UPDATE example2 set value = '2' WHERE key = 'b'"), 0);
  cass_batch_add_statement(batch, statement);
  cass_statement_free(statement);
}
 
{
  CassStatement* statement
    = cass_statement_new(cass_string_init("DELETE FROM example3 WHERE key = 'c'"), 0);
  cass_batch_add_statement(batch, statement);
  cass_statement_free(statement);
}
 
CassFuture* batch_future = cass_session_execute_batch(session, batch);
 
/* Batch objects can be freed immediately after being executed */
cass_batch_free(batch);
 
/* This will block until the query has finished */
CassError rc = cass_future_error_code(batch_future);
 
printf("Batch result: %s\n", cass_error_desc(rc));
 
cass_future_free(batch_future);
```
