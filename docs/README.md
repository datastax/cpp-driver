# Documentation

The documentation can view directly in [cassandra.h](include/cassandra.h) and in the [topics](docs/topics) directory. It's also possible to generate more readable documentation using the instructions below.

Note: The Doxygen documentation can also be generated by running `cmake; make docs` from the driver's root directory.

## Dependencies

* Ruby 1.9+
* [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)

## To generate:

This generates both the Doxygen and website documentation (under 'docs/doxygen' and 'docs/gh-pages')

```bash
gem install bundler
bundle install
rake
```
