# Binary Utilities

## Windows

* [Visual Studio Locator][vswhere] (e.g. VSWHERE) v2.1.3
  Over the years Visual Studio could be discovered using registry keys, but with recent changes to the deployment and extensibility models a new method is needed to discover possibly more than once installed instance. These changes facilitate a smaller, faster default install complimented by on-demand install of other workloads and components.
